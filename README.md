1. Created a Jupyter Notebook that compares the returns of all IPO’s from 2012-2020 to the returns of indexes such as the Russell 3000 and S&P 500. 
2. We compared the returns of ETF IPO’s and Stock IPO’s separately to the indexes. Additionally there is an analysis of the top sectors these IPO’s happened in. 
3. The notebook contains regression analysis of these stock IPO’s using the OLS regression method. 
4. Finally, we discovered which of these IPO’s made it into these broad market indexes, and then compared the IPO’s that made it to the index vs. the one’s that did not.
